## ðŸ“‚ Source Code

The source code for the Sumobot project is organized into separate files, each responsible for specific functionality within the robot. The code is written in C++ and is designed to control the motors, process sensor data, and implement the movement strategy for autonomous operation in the sumo ring.

---

### Code Structure:
- **main.ino**: The entry point of the program, responsible for initializing the system and running the main control loop.
- **motor_control.ino**: Contains the logic to control the robot's motors, including speed and direction.
- **sensor_logic.ino**: Handles sensor readings and processes data from the ultrasonic and infrared sensors for opponent detection and edge avoidance.
- **movement.ino**: Implements the robot's movement strategy, including decision-making algorithms for offense and defense.

Each file is modular, making it easy to update or add new features to the Sumobot. Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and adapt it to suit your specific needs or competition rules.
